// So far I feel pretty confident with arrays, but I also completed the JavaScript course on Code Academy prior to Mod 0. Without having do so, I would probably be freaking out a little bit. //

// I played with Replit and read through the MDN docs about the different method calls. There are a few with which I feel comfortable, but definitely have a TON to learn! //

// One question I still have about arrays: I've heard that you arrays have the functionality to include different data types within a single array (i.e. numbers and strings in one array). Why is it not a good idea (or best practice) to mix data types? //
